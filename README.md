## Problem:
  <p>According to the national wildlife foundation, if everyone in the world lived the way people lived in the US, it would take 5 earths to provide enough resources to everyone. Ozone depletion, rising temperature, melting ice caps, and rising ocean levels are primarily caused by industry and individual consumption of resources and emission of carbon. While increases in consumption and growth in industry benefit the world economically, these changes seem to exponentially damage our environment. The damage to the earth will soon outweigh the economic benefits of growth. </p>

## Solution:
<p>We would like to think that with the understanding of the information above every person living in the world would fully commit to preserving our earth, but we also understand that this isn’t realistic. Even for those individuals and corporations that have realized change is necessary, it is hard to keep these issues in forefront of their minds and incorporate changes into their daily routines. To inspire individuals and corporations to be more green, we give them the easiest reason to decrease emissions and consumption of resources through a combination of social, financial, and interactive incentives in return for completing green objectives. </p>

## User Review:
<p> A company profile who we could work with in the beginning would be a company who is ready to implement green initiatives and already has been trying but it hasn’t been efficient in the workplace. Especially smaller, growing departments and then eventually we take on giants in the various industries in order to maximize revenue and increase eco-friendliness and sustainability. </p>
